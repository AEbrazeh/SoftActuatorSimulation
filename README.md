# A Soft Robotic Actuator Framework (Under Development)
A modular simulation framework for modeling soft robotic actuators using MuJoCo.  
This project focuses on segment-wise stiffness modulation to shape a soft structure in response to internal actuation. The framework includes automatic MuJoCo XML generation, geometry modeling via arc splines, and simulation tools for control and visualization.

## üìê Core Concept

This project explores how **stiffness modulation**‚Äîwithout direct control‚Äîcan be used to shape soft structures. The actuator consists of rigid disks connected by springs, with actuation applied via tendons. By tuning the **stiffness pattern** along the structure, desired deformations can be achieved.

Target shapes are defined using arc splines, and future work will include optimization algorithms to automatically match actuator shape to arbitrary target curves.
